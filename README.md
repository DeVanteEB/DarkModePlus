# DarkModePlus
A more complete version of Discord's Dark mode via CSS injection

STEP 1:
 
To begin, you need to ensure that you can inject CSS code into your current version of Discord. To do this you must locate the file titled `index.js` located at <User Directory>\AppData\Roaming\discord\0.0.298(or whatever the current version is)\modules\discord_rpc\ Open the index.js file with some kind of text editor such as Notepad++ or Sublime (Not the regular notepad application). At the bottom of the code you will copy and paste the text found in the inject.js file (provided by Globi)

STEP 2:

Download and move the `custom.css` file into your discord_rpc folder. This will have all of the actual changes made to your client.

STEP 3:
 
Simply refresh your Discord client and all changes should be made. Feel free to explore around the app and report any issues to @DeVanteEB on Twitter! Enjoy!
